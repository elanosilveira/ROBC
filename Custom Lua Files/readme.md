Important Note:
	Be aware that these files are only tested for lua errors and functionality regarding the original files.
	In case you encounter errors, please use the discord for reporting it and PM me with your custom stuff
	so I can test them efficiently since I'm too lazy to search for stuff like that.
	
	Before using any of these files be sure to make a backup of your original ones. You have been warned!

It's pretty self-explanatory how to use these, just overwrite the original files.
